# Screen (web) scraping

In this workshop we will be making an interactive installation for the Interaction Station. The installation will be based on the plotclock, a time plotting clock. Along the way you will learn the basics of Arduino, sensors, actuators and programming. But you will also learn what it takes to make an interactive installation run by itself (e.g. no laptops attached).
