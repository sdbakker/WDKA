# Flex-It

## What are we going to make?
 * A tiger touch 'tattoo'
 * Design files: https://github.com/sdbakker/WDKA/tree/master/workshop/Flex-It/2014-2015-Q2
   * Flex-It.sch: this is the schematic of the electronic circuit
   * Flex-It.brd: board layout (this will be your circuit design)
   * Flex-It-routed.brd: this is an example board layout already routed

## First create a circuit and layout
 * [CadSoft eagle](http://www.cadsoftusa.com/)
 * [KiCad](http://www.kicad-pcb.org/display/KICAD/KiCad+EDA+Software+Suite)
 * [Fritzing](http://fritzing.org/home/)


## Getting your circuit on a flexible circuit board at home
 * [Using a cutting plotter](http://www.kobakant.at/DIY/?p=5371)
 * [Using toner transfer method](http://www.instructables.com/id/Cheap-and-Easy-Toner-Transfer-for-PCB-Making/) (don't forget to mirror the image)
 * [Sharpie](http://www.sharpie.com/Pages/GlobalLanding.aspx)
 * [Using a solid ink printer](http://www.instructables.com/id/DIY-Flexible-Printed-Circuits/step2/Use-a-solid-ink-printer/) (don't need to mirror)

## Etching
 * We will use Iron(III)Chloride or Fe3CL, this removes all the copper not covered.
 * Be very careful, these are nasty chemicals!!

## Adding the components
 * Solder the components on your circuit board
 * We are using [SMD components](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Surface-mount_technology)!
 * Be precise, it is easy to make a short circuit as we do not have a solder mask
