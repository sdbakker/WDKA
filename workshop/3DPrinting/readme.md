# 3D Printing

3D Printing is een additive manufacturing process. This means an object is constructed by adding layers of material. This is in contrast with subtractive processes like milling where material is removed.

## A (non-exhaustive) list of Several 3D printing Methods
 * Stereolitography (SL or SLA): uses a an UV laser beam to harden a UV curable resin
   [Formlabs](https://www.youtube.com/user/formlabs1) is one of the first home type SLA printers
 * Selective Laser Sintering (SLS): uses a laserbeam to melt fine particles of material together. Used e.g. for metal objects
 * Binder-jetting: uses a platform of plaster like powder and inkjet printing technology to apply a binder.
 * Fused Deposition Modeling (FDM): uses an extruded thermoplast laying thin lines on top of each other. Not totally unlike but not quite like using glue gun.
